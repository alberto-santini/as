\subsection{Detailed Description}
This namespace contains classes and functions related to the O\+P\+L\+IB. 

The O\+P\+L\+IB is a collection of instances of the Orienteering Problem. The instance files have a perverted format which is vexing to parse, and is an extension of the T\+S\+P\+L\+IB format. These utilities aim at making the parsing of the instances easier for the user.
